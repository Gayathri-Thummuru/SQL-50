SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id!=2 OR referee_id IS NULL;



SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_Id <> 2;
However, this query will only return one result:Zack although there are 4 customers not referred by Jane (including Jane herself). All the customers who were referred by nobody at all (NULL value in the referee_id column) don’t show up. But why?

Algorithm
MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL.

Thus, one more condition 'referee_id IS NULL' should be added to the WHERE clause as below.
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id!=2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
